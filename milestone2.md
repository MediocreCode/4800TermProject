### Problem Definition
As a university student, there are too many external systems managed by the university/departments/instructors for classes that all fall under the same institution. We want to investigate where these frustrations stem from for students and why instructors have chosen to use many differing systems. This is especially prevalent in a time in which both students and instructors return to face-to-face instruction, as previous online material and course-work is integrated back into the normal classroom setting.  

Our proposed solution is to have the majority of the functions both students and instructors look for into one integrated platform. Ideally, we would like to make our solution as simple and intuitive as possible through the use of clear signifiers in order to accommodate for user affordances. A typical interaction related to our problem would be a student wanting to check their grades. According to the seven stages of action, the goal would be to check grades. The plan would be to visit each platform the student may use for each class (WebAssign, eLC, TopHat, etc). The specific action sequence would be to individually visit each platform and navigate to wherever the grades for that platform are stored. To perform this sequence, the student would have to go to each platform on their web browser of choice and perform the action sequence. The perception would be both the experience the student had when viewing grades (i.e. was it a hassle?), as well as the grades observed which then could be interpreted as good or bad. The student may then compare the ease of viewing grades on each platform.

#### Potential Users
For our system we have a total of 3 potential users:
* The first user is the student who is on the “receiving end” of the system. Students have the least amount of options when it comes to the platform and the tasks they primarily perform are: viewing grades, taking quizzes/exams, and participating/uploading discussions and posts.
* The second user is the Instructor who serves as an intermediary between the student and the University System. The Instructor has a wide variety of options to perform, but primarily stick to: posting/updating grades, posting announcements, uploading course materials, and the creation and release of quizzes/exams.
* The third and final user is the University System who implements the platform. The University system interacts the least with the platform however are responsible for purchasing and implementing the service(s).

### Analysis of Existing Solutions
There are no real existing solutions to our problem as all the platforms that exists which instructors and students can make use of are actually a part of the issue we are aiming to fix. Based on our experience, the closest thing to an existing solution would be eLC as it offers a wide (but not comprehensive enough) variety of services such as grades, exams, and discussions. However, once again based on our experience, it lacks certain core features such as more variable exam formats (WebAssign), randomized discussions, and in-class participation features (TopHat).

#### Principles and Guidelines for Existing Solutions
The main guideline that all these services adhere to lies under the fact that they are all secure to a degree, which prevents students from gaining administrative access. Obviously, this is beneficial to school faculty who do not want students poking around where they are not supposed to. This helps the faculty maintain control and release information when they see fit. Keeping the users in control is a key principle of good design and is certainly maintained across these many systems that help distribute information. These systems also do well at reducing short-term memory load for the student users as they have clearly defined sections for homework, quizzes, and exams. The main problem with this principle comes into is when a student user has to take into account many of these different systems and overload their short term memory. This problem also lacks at maintaining consistent streams of action for students. For example, a student may have to both submit an assignment on one system and then re-upload that assign on a separate system in order to secure the submission incase one system fails to upload.

### Our Solutions
We would like to propose an external system that can incorporate these already existing solutions which are used for their unique benefits (elC, TopHat, WebAssign, etc.) and take the best properties of each system for an overarching "Umbrella" system. This system would allow student users to have a single hub where they can access course information and assignment deadlines without having to encounter the problem of overloading their short-term memory. The benefits of this system for instructors is that they will still be able to pick and choose from the already existing solutions that they have come to know, so they would not have to go through the difficulties of learning a new system. An added benefit is that having all assignments and grades in one place will allow for less user error on the students side of confusion when deadlines occur, thus enabling instructors to focus more on the details of their lesson plans.

#### Measuring Success
We would measure success by comparing the number of missed assignments, grades, and classroom engagement from prior to using Swyng and after the student uses our system. We would collect feedback from students on the overall usability of our platform and insight from instructors on the number of communications received from students regarding assignment deadlines and confusion. If we are able to determine a significant decrease in missed assignments and student frustration, we would be able to say that our design was successful.

<!-- Poole is the Jekyll Butler, serving as an upstanding and effective foundation for Jekyll themes by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo). Poole, and every theme built on it (like Hyde here) includes the following:

* Complete Jekyll setup included (layouts, config, [404](/404), [RSS feed](/atom.xml), posts, and [example page](/about))
* Mobile friendly design and development
* Easily scalable text and component sizing with `rem` units in the CSS
* Support for a wide gamut of HTML elements
* Related posts (time-based, because Jekyll) below each post
* Syntax highlighting, courtesy Pygments (the Python-based code snippet highlighter)

### Hyde features

In addition to the features of Poole, Hyde adds the following:

* Sidebar includes support for textual modules and a dynamically generated navigation with active link support
* Two orientations for content and sidebar, default (left sidebar) and [reverse](https://github.com/poole/lanyon#reverse-layout) (right sidebar), available via `<body>` classes
* [Eight optional color schemes](https://github.com/poole/hyde#themes), available via `<body>` classes

[Head to the readme](https://github.com/poole/hyde#readme) to learn more.

### Browser support

Hyde is by preference a forward-thinking project. In addition to the latest versions of Chrome, Safari (mobile and desktop), and Firefox, it is only compatible with Internet Explorer 9 and above.

### Download

Hyde is developed on and hosted with GitHub. Head to the <a href="https://github.com/poole/hyde">GitHub repository</a> for downloads, bug reports, and features requests.
