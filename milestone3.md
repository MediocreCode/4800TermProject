### User Experience Requirements
#### User Stories
* <b>As a student, I would like to have a single location where I can access all my assignments for classes so that I can have a more organized educational experience.</b>
* <b>As an instructor, I would like to reduce confusion among students so that I may focus more on the lesson plan rather than reminding students where assignments are located and when they are due.</b>
* As an institution I would like a service which is applicable to my organizational needs (education), while being reliable and affordable.
* As an instructor, I would like to not have to learn new platforms, so that I may continue using my existing knowledge on platforms such as Piazza, WebAssign, etc.
* <b>As a student, I want to be able to view all my grades in one platform, so that I can keep track of my academics without having to access numerous platforms for each class.</b>
* As a student, I want to be able to interact with other students using a platform that helps interaction happen in an easy and simplistic way.
* As a student, I need to be able to complete any assignments (tests & quizzes) with minimal errors and issues.
* As an instructor, I would like to be able to easily and randomly assign students for peer review assignments.
* <b>As an instructor, I would like the ability to create quizzes and tests to my liking without having to deal with confusing interfaces and requirements.</b>
* As an instructor I would like to be able to view my student’s work submissions.

#### Relevance
We firmly believe that the bolded user stories are the most relevant to our solution.

The first user story is relevant as the idea of students being able to have a single platform where they can access school material is the primary inspiration for our solution. As students, the clutter of platforms which make up our current instructional media, is a logistical mess as students are forced to juggle multiple services. This feature is demonstrated in our “class page” wireframe where students are easily able to view and select assignments and content from a course in which  they are enrolled in.

In addition to this, the second user story goes hand-in-hand to our first as students who come from a system which does not implement online educational platforms or implement drastically different ones may struggle with finding where and when assignments are due. Freshmen especially, who are unfamiliar with the layouts of platforms such as eLC, and WebAssign often struggle to remember and find upcoming assignments. With an idea of upcoming assignments clearly displayed, our “calendar” wireframe has this feature conveniently built in. This wireframe not only shows a virtual calendar which lists class times and locations, but also a reminder subsection which lists upcoming due dates in order. As the subsection is large and the text is bolded, it is difficult to miss and aims to ensure students do not forget about important dates.

Next, we found the fifth user story to be of one with relevance as it is a practical feature of our very first user story. Students should be able to view all of their grades in a singular platform without the need to switch between services in order to ensure that each student knows how they are doing in their classes. When all grades are present in the same space, it can become easy and convenient to quickly swipe through them in order to get an idea of academic standing for the semester, as opposed to individually having to visit different spaces for each class. In order to achieve this, we implemented a “gradebook” wireframe which allows a student to view all of their current grades in a course. This wireframe also has a built in grade calculator which students can use in order to get an understanding of their academic standing in the course.

The final user story we found to be relevant is the ninth one as instructors should be able to easily deliver assignments and instruction material with little to no hassle. We recognize that the instructor experience is just as important as the experience of the students and thus we found this user story to be just as equally important. Through a wireframe which includes a “link” option we allow instructors to create assignments in whatever format or platform they are most familiar/comfortable with, then easily import the assignment into the course.



### Ideation and Preliminary Designs
#### Idea Generation
We used Figma to brainstorm different practical ideas that we could implement for our system. You can see our session [here.](https://www.figma.com/file/5Gcm3kk0GAqFyUAxTM5ifP/4800IdeaGeneration) The ideas that are in bold and marked with a stamp are designs that we feel will help push us closer to realizing our goals set out in how we measure success.

#### Class Page Justification
We wanted a bold definitive header so that the student always knows what class they are accessing. The sidebar and header work in unison to create the smaller presenter screen where all course and assignment information will be shown.

We chose the sidebar design for its simplicity as it allows the student to traverse all needed information very easily. We wanted opening the dropdown menu in the sidebar to not push everything below it out of sight to be scrolled to, but instead locks the important other dropdown menus at the bottom and creates a smaller scrollable window between the selected information and other accessible information.

The presenter acts as a blank slate for any selected item to be cast. We felt the 1000W by 900H was appropriate sizing to not be too small and make the presenter feel cramped. We also chose to keep the presented information very plain and uncomplicated. We didn't want to overload the user with information as that was one of our design goals in Milestone 2 and synergizes well with completing our user stories.

#### Calendar Justification
For the approaching due dates, we chose to include this in the side bar on the homepage. The sidebar will be sticky, meaning when the student scrolls down, the sidebar will remain the same. This way, no matter what part of the homepage the student is looking at, their due dates will be readily available. For close deadlines, the due date will be bolded and in red to bring attention to it. Students may configure the time range they would like to have the bolded and colored due dates.

The calendar page shows the calendar in the main area, but also a list of classes in the right side bar. This way, students can easily navigate to any class from the calendar page without having to go back into the homepage.

#### Grade Justification
For our gradepage, we decided to go with a traditional downwards growthing gradebook style template. We found that this type of layout would be the most comfortable for students and instructors to use as it is a familiar layout which students and instructors would have seen in the past. Such a simple and easy to read layout reduces the amount of confusion students and instructors may potentially face. The gradebook contains multiple sections which in larger text name the category of assignment each grade is for. The individual names of each assignment is on the left, and the grades are on the right. This allowed us to create a gradebook that is systematically organized and easy to read.

On the right hand side of the grades page, we have our grade calculator. It made sense to us to place this on the right hand side as students can easily reference their grades and simply enter them into the calculator without having to navigate back and forth through multiple pages.We found this type of calculator which requires manual inputs to be the best design for students as it allows students controllability. This is an important feature in a grade calculator as it allows students to put in “what-if” grades in order to gain a better understanding of their standing in the course. Such a feature can help with predicting possible grade outcomes throughout the semester as well. By having the calculator right next to the gradebook on the same page, we minimize the amount of effort needed as students do not have to flip back and forth between the gradebook and the calculator to input in grades.

#### Instructor Linking Justification
We went with the idea that selecting the link tab would create a pop-up that displays the different compatible options as seen in Frame 1. This also leaves room for Swyng to grow as more options become compatible they can then be added to the pop-up and Swyng would do the rest. The due date would be access the same way as the type through a pop-up calendar window. This is needed if the assignment was from a previous semester and needed a new due date. There is an additional option for announcing the assignment being posted to the class via checkbox. Without checking the assignment would be posted hidden and only visible to the instructor to be announced at a later date. We went with this as there a many instructors out there that don't want to overwhelm students with information and keeping the assignment hidden until relevant.

### Problem Definition
As a university student, there are too many external systems managed by the university/departments/instructors for classes that all fall under the same institution. We want to investigate where this frustration stems from for students and why instructors have chosen to use many differing systems. This is especially prevalent in a time in which both students and instructors return to face-to-face instruction, as previous online material and course-work is integrated back into the normal classroom setting.  

Our proposed solution is to have the majority of the functions both students and instructors look for in one integrated platform. Ideally, we would like to make our solution as simple and intuitive as possible through the use of clear signifiers in order to accommodate for user affordances. A typical interaction related to our problem would be a student wanting to check their grades. According to the seven stages of action, the goal would be to check grades. The plan would be to visit each platform the student may use for each class (webassign, eLC, tophat, etc). The specific action sequence would be to individually visit each platform and navigate to wherever the grades for that platform are stored. To perform this sequence, the student would have to go to each platform on their web browser of choice and perform the action sequence. The perception would be both the experience the student had when viewing grades (i.e. was it a hassle), as well as the grades observed which then could be interpreted as good or bad. The student may then compare the ease of viewing grades on each platform.

#### Potential Users
For our system we have a total of 3 potential users.
* The first user is the student who is on the “receiving end” of the system. Students have the least amount of options when it comes to the platform and the tasks they primarily perform are: viewing grades, taking quizzes/exams, and participating/uploading discussions and posts.
* The second user is the Instructor who serves as an intermediary between the student and the University System. The Instructor has a wide variety of options to perform, but primarily stick to: posting/updating grades, posting announcements, uploading course materials, and the creation and release of quizzes/exams.
* The third and final user is the University System who implements the platform. The University system interacts the least with the platform however are responsible for purchasing and implementing the service(s).

### Analysis of Existing Solutions
There are no real existing solutions to our problem as all the platforms that exists which instructors and students can make use of are actually a part of the issue we are aiming to fix. Based on our experience, the closest thing to an existing solution would be eLC as it offers a wide (but not comprehensive enough) variety of services such as grades, exams, and discussions. However, based on our experience, it lacks certain core features such as randomized discussions, more variable exam formats (like WebAssign), and in-class participation features (TopHat).

### Principles and Guidelines for Existing Solutions
The main guideline that all these services adhere to, lies under the fact that they are all secure to a degree, which prevents students from gaining administrative access.
