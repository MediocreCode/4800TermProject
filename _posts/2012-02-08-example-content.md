### Problem Definition
As a university student, there are too many external systems managed by the university/departments/instructors for classes that all fall under the same institution. We want to investigate where this frustration stems from for students and why instructors have chosen to use many differing systems. This is especially prevalent in a time in which both students and instructors return to face-to-face instruction, as previous online material and course-work is integrated back into the normal classroom setting.  

Our proposed solution is to have the majority of the functions both students and instructors look for in one integrated platform. Ideally, we would like to make our solution as simple and intuitive as possible through the use of clear signifiers in order to accommodate for user affordances. A typical interaction related to our problem would be a student wanting to check their grades. According to the seven stages of action, the goal would be to check grades. The plan would be to visit each platform the student may use for each class (webassign, eLC, tophat, etc). The specific action sequence would be to individually visit each platform and navigate to wherever the grades for that platform are stored. To perform this sequence, the student would have to go to each platform on their web browser of choice and perform the action sequence. The perception would be both the experience the student had when viewing grades (i.e. was it a hassle), as well as the grades observed which then could be interpreted as good or bad. The student may then compare the ease of viewing grades on each platform.

#### Potential Users
For our system we have a total of 3 potential users.
* The first user is the student who is on the “receiving end” of the system. Students have the least amount of options when it comes to the platform and the tasks they primarily perform are: viewing grades, taking quizzes/exams, and participating/uploading discussions and posts.
* The second user is the Instructor who serves as an intermediary between the student and the University System. The Instructor has a wide variety of options to perform, but primarily stick to: posting/updating grades, posting announcements, uploading course materials, and the creation and release of quizzes/exams.
* The third and final user is the University System who implements the platform. The University system interacts the least with the platform however are responsible for purchasing and implementing the service(s).

### Analysis of Existing Solutions
There are no real existing solutions to our problem as all the platforms that exists which instructors and students can make use of are actually a part of the issue we are aiming to fix. Based on our experience, the closest thing to an existing solution would be eLC as it offers a wide (but not comprehensive enough) variety of services such as grades, exams, and discussions. However, based on our experience, it lacks certain core features such as randomized discussions, more variable exam formats (like WebAssign), and in-class participation features (TopHat).

###Principles and Guidelines for Existing Solutions
The main guideline that all these services adhere to, lies under the fact that they are all secure to a degree, which prevents students from gaining administrative access.

<!-- Poole is the Jekyll Butler, serving as an upstanding and effective foundation for Jekyll themes by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo). Poole, and every theme built on it (like Hyde here) includes the following:

* Complete Jekyll setup included (layouts, config, [404](/404), [RSS feed](/atom.xml), posts, and [example page](/about))
* Mobile friendly design and development
* Easily scalable text and component sizing with `rem` units in the CSS
* Support for a wide gamut of HTML elements
* Related posts (time-based, because Jekyll) below each post
* Syntax highlighting, courtesy Pygments (the Python-based code snippet highlighter)

### Hyde features

In addition to the features of Poole, Hyde adds the following:

* Sidebar includes support for textual modules and a dynamically generated navigation with active link support
* Two orientations for content and sidebar, default (left sidebar) and [reverse](https://github.com/poole/lanyon#reverse-layout) (right sidebar), available via `<body>` classes
* [Eight optional color schemes](https://github.com/poole/hyde#themes), available via `<body>` classes

[Head to the readme](https://github.com/poole/hyde#readme) to learn more.

### Browser support

Hyde is by preference a forward-thinking project. In addition to the latest versions of Chrome, Safari (mobile and desktop), and Firefox, it is only compatible with Internet Explorer 9 and above.

### Download

Hyde is developed on and hosted with GitHub. Head to the <a href="https://github.com/poole/hyde">GitHub repository</a> for downloads, bug reports, and features requests.

Thanks! -->
