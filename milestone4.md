### Testing Protocol

Our research question is as follows: Are students and instructors more productive, efficient, and satisfied when using one umbrella system over the multiple past systems they have grown accustomed to?

#### Protocol

The practical way we would plan conducting this research uses a few of methodologies comprised of surveys, interviews, and an experiment.
We would use surveys to gauge user feedback from a statistical view of our total sample. Judging feedback from our users such as numerical values of overall enjoyment, responsiveness, and difficulty to learn. This could be used both on instructor and student users, but our sample size of instructors would most likely be disproportionally small compared to the sample size of our students.
Our current list of information we would gather from surveys is as follows:

Qualitative:
* Enjoyment
* Responsiveness
* Difficulty to learn the new system

Quantitative:
* Number of missed assignments
* Average class grade compared to previous classes taught outside of Swyng.


This is where our other methodology of using interviews would come into play. Being able to go in-depth with the instructor users using the system and gage how they are feeling about usability as well as note what there feedback from students is like as far as their expressing discontent and confusing leading to missed assignments. We could also interview a random handful of students to get a more clear picture of how our features like calendar and grade calculator have help or hindered their ability to maintain ease of use of the system.

Finally, we would conduct an experiment using a control set of students and instructors going through classes using different systems that they do currently and a treatment set of students and instructors who have all their classes accessed and taught through Swyng. In the end we would compare these two groups based on the Quantitative metrics previously mentioned for the surveys. This would give us firm insight on just what a semester under an umbrella system would look like for our users.

#### Testing Procedure

Our primary methodology of testing would be to get a sample size of students and instructors and to allow them to “play” with Swyng to get a general idea of the features after a basic idea. We would ask each student participant to look at and experiment with the various features of Swyng, such as the overall interface layout, the calendar, the grade calculator, and the quiz/assignment taking format. Instructors participants would look at each of these as well as an additional assignment creation tool. After this process, we would ask each participant to take a survey to rate their general experience in terms of overall enjoyment, the responsiveness of the system, and their opinion on how difficult they think the system is to learn as a new user. We would use a typical 0 - 5 rating system in which a 0 is not satisfactory, and a 5 is very satisfactory. In addition to this, our survey would make use of an “additional” comments section so that participants would be able to add any relevant feedback they wish to give. The scores given in each quantitative section would then be compiled in order to produce standing averages to see the general response to the satisfaction level of Swyng.

In terms of a more in-depth and longer term case study, we would ask instructors to teach one class using another online course delivery system for one class, and Swyng for another. After a select period or after a certain number of assignments had been delivered, we would collect qualitative data in terms of: the average grades and the average number of missed assignments. This would allow us to assess whether Swyng has an actual quantifiable advantage over other systems in the market.

We recognize the importance of informed consent in any research setting which involves third party participants, thus we plan to ensure every member from student to instructor are informed. We plan to accomplish this through ensuring each participant is cognizant of their decision to participate and that they understand that under no circumstances are they forced to participate. We plan to obtain signatures of their consent through forms prior to any sort of user testing in order to ensure each participant is aware of their legal right to refuse. Each consent form will be disclosed to each participant. As our experiment and testing is not of a medical nature the only possible “effects” to our participants are the fact that they may have to learn a new system in order to complete and view course work which may or may not affect their performance in the class work. This is something we plan to take seriously and ensure each participant is aware of this as well. Should a participant not want to take part in our testing, we would simply ask the instructor to digitally add them to a section which does not incorporate Swyng. As the vast majority of our testing is done digitally there is no need for us to worry about the pandemic with regards to data collecting and survey distribution.

### Problem Definition
As a university student, there are too many external systems managed by the university/departments/instructors for classes that all fall under the same institution. We want to investigate where this frustration stems from for students and why instructors have chosen to use many differing systems. This is especially prevalent in a time in which both students and instructors return to face-to-face instruction, as previous online material and course-work is integrated back into the normal classroom setting.  

Our proposed solution is to have the majority of the functions both students and instructors look for in one integrated platform. Ideally, we would like to make our solution as simple and intuitive as possible through the use of clear signifiers in order to accommodate for user affordances. A typical interaction related to our problem would be a student wanting to check their grades. According to the seven stages of action, the goal would be to check grades. The plan would be to visit each platform the student may use for each class (webassign, eLC, tophat, etc). The specific action sequence would be to individually visit each platform and navigate to wherever the grades for that platform are stored. To perform this sequence, the student would have to go to each platform on their web browser of choice and perform the action sequence. The perception would be both the experience the student had when viewing grades (i.e. was it a hassle), as well as the grades observed which then could be interpreted as good or bad. The student may then compare the ease of viewing grades on each platform.

#### Potential Users
For our system we have a total of 3 potential users.
* The first user is the student who is on the “receiving end” of the system. Students have the least amount of options when it comes to the platform and the tasks they primarily perform are: viewing grades, taking quizzes/exams, and participating/uploading discussions and posts.
* The second user is the Instructor who serves as an intermediary between the student and the University System. The Instructor has a wide variety of options to perform, but primarily stick to: posting/updating grades, posting announcements, uploading course materials, and the creation and release of quizzes/exams.
* The third and final user is the University System who implements the platform. The University system interacts the least with the platform however are responsible for purchasing and implementing the service(s).

### Analysis of Existing Solutions
There are no real existing solutions to our problem as all the platforms that exists which instructors and students can make use of are actually a part of the issue we are aiming to fix. Based on our experience, the closest thing to an existing solution would be eLC as it offers a wide (but not comprehensive enough) variety of services such as grades, exams, and discussions. However, based on our experience, it lacks certain core features such as randomized discussions, more variable exam formats (like WebAssign), and in-class participation features (TopHat).

### Principles and Guidelines for Existing Solutions
The main guideline that all these services adhere to, lies under the fact that they are all secure to a degree, which prevents students from gaining administrative access.
